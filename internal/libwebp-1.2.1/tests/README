Description:
============

This is a collection of tests for the libwebp libraries, currently covering
fuzzing through the APIs. Additional test vector coverage can be found at:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp-test-data

Building:
=========

Fuzzers:
--------

Follow the build instructions in ../README for libwebp, optionally adding build
flags for various sanitizers (e.g., -fsanitize=address).

fuzzer/makefile.unix can then be used to compile the fuzzer targets:

$ make -C fuzzer -f makefile.unix
